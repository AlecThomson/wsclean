Facet based imaging
===================

WSClean provides experimental support for facet-based imaging, and applying direction dependent effects (DDEs) per facet.
A facet should be understood as a (polygonal shaped) subdomain of the full image, where both convex and concave polygons are supported.
A first advantage of facet-based imaging is that DDEs can be applied per facet. Apart from this, parallelization and reducing the memory footprint
can be other other advantages of facet-based imaging. This owes to the fact that inverting the visibilities to the image domain and predicting the visibilities can largely be done on each
facet independently, rather than on the full image.

Availability
------------
Facetting is available in WSClean :doc:`version 3.0 <changelogs/v3.0>` and later.

Command-line options
--------------------

To enable facet-based imaging in WSClean, a file containing the facet definitions should be provided via the :code:`-facet-regions` option on the command line:

.. code-block:: text

    -facet-regions <MY_REGIONS_FILE>

in which :code:`[MY_REGIONS_FILE]` is a file the contains the facet definitions using the DS9 region file format.

Enabling the facet beam correction can be done with the option

.. code-block:: text

    -apply-facet-beam

The facet beam update interval (in seconds) can be defined by specifying:

.. code-block:: text

    -facet-beam-update <seconds>

The default value for the update interval is 120s.

Direction dependent corrections per facet can also be read and applied from an H5Parm file - which in essence is a HDF5 file with some prescribed lay-out.
This is done via the command-line option:

.. code-block:: text

    -apply-facet-solutions <path-to-h5parm> <name1[,name2]>

where :code:`<path-to-h5parm>` is the path to the H5Parm file and :code:`<name1[,name2]>`
is a comma-separated list of strings specifying which "soltabs" from the provided H5Parm file are used.
Acceptable names are :code:`ampl000` and/or :code:`phase000`.

**NOTE:** the ordering of the directions in the H5Parm file is currently **assumed** equal to the ordering of the facets in the DS9 region file.

Example command
---------------
An example facet-based imaging command in WSClean, applying both a facet-based beam correction as well as a gain correction from an H5Parm file could be:

.. code-block:: bash

    wsclean \
    -apply-facet-solutions mock_soltab_2pol.h5 ampl000,phase000 \
    -facet-regions ds9.reg \
    -apply-facet-beam \
    -facet-beam-update 120 \
    -niter 1000000 -auto-threshold 5 -mgain 0.8 \
    -size 1024 1024 -scale 1amin \
    ${ms}


Caveats
-------

Facet-based imaging is currently an experimental feature, and therefore should be used with care.
A (probably non-exhaustive) list of caveats is presented below:

- Parallel processing can be enabled with the :code:`-parallel-gridding` option (multi-threaded) or the :code:`wsclean-mp` (using MPI). Parallelization over facets is however barely tested, and may return unexpected errors or results. In particular when applying DDEs.
- Facet-based imaging in conjunction with the Image Domain Gridder (IDG) is only possible without applying DDEs.
- When applying solutions in WSClean for facetted imaging, only scalar solutions are currently applicable.
- Be aware of the (direction) ordering restriction when applying DD gains from an H5Parm file as mentioned above.

# Tests the facet degridding by taking the following sequence of steps:
# - Predict the visibilities from provided model image (without facetting) and
#    write predicted visibilities to MODEL_DATA column of MS_0
# - Copy MS_0 to MS_1 that will be used for facet based imaging (requires DP3)
# - Run an imaging cycle (including a number of major iterations) using facets
# - Check whether MODEL_DATA column of MS_0 and MS_1 are close for the facet that
#    contains the point sources, and close to zero for all other facets.
